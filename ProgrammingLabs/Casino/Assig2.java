 * amount from 0 to 100 (assume dollars, you can use ints or longs).  If the 
 * user types a 0 that means she wants to quit.  Otherwise, accept the amount as
 * their bet and simulate a slot machine pull.  Your program will print out a 
 * line that looks like a slot machine result containing three strings."
